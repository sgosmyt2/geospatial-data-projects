# Spatial Analysis of Drought and Extreme Rainfall Risk

This project explores the geospatial characteristics of drought and extreme rainfall using satellite derived precipitation data and geospatial tools in Python.
Using a percentile framework, rainfall conditions are evaluated via local climatology, allowing climate risk to be assessed across regions with different climates.

## Current Analysis
- Temporal analysis of daily rainfall variability
- Identification of representative drought and extreme rainfall events
- Spatial mapping of climate risk using percentile thresholds
- Raster–vector clipping using GeoPandas and rioxarray
  
- This was using Chad

## Methods
- Data: CHIRPS daily precipitation
- Tools: xarray, GeoPandas, rioxarray, matplotlib
- Metrics: local precipitation percentiles

## Planned Extensions
- Comparative case study in a second region (e.g. Southeast Asia or South America)
- Cross regional comparison of drought and extreme rainfall patterns
- Summary statistics comparing climate risk profiles across regions
- Further expanding on Chad for a greater comparison with the other country

This repository is intended as a portfolio project demonstrating applied geospatial and climate data analysis.
