# Dzud and Drought, the affects of extreme weather on regional drought and climate risks

This project explores the geospatial characteristics of drought and extreme rainfall using satellite derived precipitation data and geospatial tools in Python.
Using a percentile framework, rainfall conditions are evaluated via local climatology, allowing climate risk to be assessed across regions with different climates.

## Current Analysis
- Temporal analysis of daily rainfall variability
- Identification of representative drought and extreme rainfall events
- Spatial mapping of climate risk using percentile thresholds
- Raster–vector clipping using GeoPandas and rioxarray
  
- This was using Chad

## Methods
- Data: CHIRPS daily precipitation
- Tools: xarray, GeoPandas, rioxarray, matplotlib
- Metrics: local precipitation percentiles

## Planned Extensions
- Comparative case study in Mongolia and the Dzud of 2011
- Cross regional comparison of drought and extreme rainfall patterns
- Summary statistics comparing climate risk profiles across regions
- Comparison of Chad historically and now to show the extreme affects of the regional drought in the timespan 2010-2012
- Further expanding on Chad for a greater comparison with the other country


This repository is intended as a portfolio project demonstrating applied geospatial and climate data analysis.
